# FundamentalTheoremOfCalculus
The proof uses the definition for integration and differentiation to prove the theorem.
It consists of:  
Taking the integral of a derivative ∫df(x)/dx dx = ∫df(x)
1. ∫df(x) basically is rewritten as an alternating series
2. All terms of the series cancel out leaving behind
    - f(x) + c for indefinite integrals
    - f(b) - f(a) for definite integrals
