# FundamentalTheoremOfCalculus
The proof uses the definition for integration and differentiation to prove the theorem.
It consists of:  
Taking the integral of a derivative ∫df(x)/dx dx = ∫df(x)
1. ∫df(x) basically is rewritten as an alternating series
2. All terms of the series cancel out leaving behind
    - f(x) + c for indefinite integrals
    - f(b) - f(a) for definite integrals
##### The argument can be stated concisely as:
∫df(x)/dx dx = ∫df(x) = Δf(x) = f(x) - f(x~0) |  f(b) - f(a) : for the closed interval [a, b]
Agregating all the small changes df(x) in f(x) should add up to the total or net change Δf(x) for a given interval
